# sklearn_notes
These are notebooks following along the official scikit-learn documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html

Notebooks are numbered by the same nomenclature as the official documentation. 

I'm shorthanding outlines and re-typing some code, also copying much code.

##### Objectives:
* learn more about scikit-learn
* stay in the habit of regular coding
* explore git and markdown functionalities
